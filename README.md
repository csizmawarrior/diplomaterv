## How to change the default Board and type definitions:

The game expects a folder named "files" in the same directory in which the LabWork1Github project's folder is. 

In that folder there are 7 files, out of which the BoardCreation.txt is not in action by default.

In the project's "static constants" folder you can change the file address in the FileNames.cs file to your files.
The ExampleBoard.txt is the board description by default, the monster and trap type files all load by default as well.
